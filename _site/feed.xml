<h3 id="will-west-case">Will West Case</h3>

<p>Littlewood writes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dorothy Sayers in Unpopular Opinions, cites the case of two negroes, each named Will West, confined simultaneously in Leavenworth Penitentiary, U.S.A. (in 1903), and with the same Bertillon measurements. (Is this really credible ?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We estimate this probability, let $P$ be the probability that two people share the same facial features, Bertillon measurements and name. We have:</p>

\[P \approx \underbrace{\text{Prob(same body measurements)}}_{:=P_b} \; \cdot \;  \underbrace{\text{Prob(same name)}}_{:=P_n}\]

<h5 id="estimationg-p_n">Estimationg \(P_n\)</h5>

<p>Let \(n_1, n_2\) be the names of two arbitrary people. We have the crude approximation:</p>

\[P(n_1 = n_2) = \sum_{\text{names }n} P(n_1 = n) P(n_2 = n) = \sum_{\text{names } n} P(n)^2\]

<p>Using data from <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/">U.S. Social Security Adminbistration</a> and using the top 1000 names from the years 1880 and 2010 (assuming that 50% of births are male and 50% of births are female), we <a href="https://gist.github.com/epistemologist/12cff945e6b8c918055f5585fc373c7f">get estimates</a> of probabilities of 1.8% and 0.21% respectively. Assuming that choosing first names and last names are independent, we estimate that $ P_n \approx 10^{-2} \cdot 10^{-2} = 10^{-4} $</p>

<h5 id="estimating-p_b">Estimating \(P_b\)</h5>

<p>Littlewood mentions that the two Wests’ shared Bermillon measurements - these are a system of 11 different biometric measurements that were taken of prisoners as means of identification. In the original case, the measurements of the two Wests’ were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505160629/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/whats-in-a-name-part-2/">not exactly the same, but remarkably similar</a>.</p>

<p>Bertillon <a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2014.00739.x">himself predicted</a> that the probability of two people sharing all 11 measurements was \(P_b \approx 1/4^{32} = 1/268435456\). However, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00414-015-1158-6">more recent studies</a> in forensic anthropometry place the probability of two people sharing 8 different body measurement traits at \(P_b \approx 10^{-20}\).</p>

<p>We therefore make the estimate \(P_b \approx 10^{-12}\) and therefore, \(P \approx 10^{-12} \cdot \cdot 10^{-4} = 10^{-16}\).</p>

<h5 id="wrapping-things-up">Wrapping Things Up</h5>

<p>We now calculate the probability that for any one person being incarcerated that they share the same features to someone in the same prison that they are being held similarly to the two Will Wests.</p>

<p>Assuming an average prison houses an average of <a href="https://www.americanjail.org/jail-statistics">250 inmates</a>, the probability that a person who is imprisoned meets their doppelganger in the same prison is \(p = 1 - (1-P)^{250}\).</p>

<p>Therefore, if $n$ people are incarcerated, we have that the probability that any one person will find their doppelganger is \(p' = 1 - (1-p)^n = 1 - (1-P)^{250n}\).
Considering that the U.S. made <a href="https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/ucr.asp?table_in=2">10 million arrests in 2019</a>, we estimate \(N \approx 5 \cdot 10^6\). We therefore have that:</p>

\[p' = 1 - (1-P)^{N} = 1 - \left( 1 - NP + \frac{N(N-1)}{2} P^2 - \cdots \right) = NP + O(P^2)\]

<p>Plugging in \(N = 250 \cdot 5 \cdot 10^6, P = 10^{-16}\), we get that $p’ \approx 10^{-7}$.</p>

<p>This probability is reasonable as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger#Examples_in_real_life">various doppelgangers have been found in real life</a> and so we expect it to be within the realm of possibility.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="uuiate" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coincidences / Probabilities]]></summary></entry></feed>
