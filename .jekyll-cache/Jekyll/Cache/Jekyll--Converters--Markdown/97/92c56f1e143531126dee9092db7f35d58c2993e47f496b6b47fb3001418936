I"<p>Recently, I came across <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/36822/">an old StackExchange thread</a> wherein users submitted â€œlockersâ€ or functions which only accepted a certain arithmetic sequence - then other users attempted to â€œcrackâ€ these lockers by providing said sequence. As a fun weekend challenge, I decided to crack one of these lockers that had remained uncracked for 9 years.</p>
